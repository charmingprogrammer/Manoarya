  Topic: `<div class="infos"><h2>Computer</h2><p>The computer is an electronic machine that runs on three principles. <br><br>1. Input <br>2. Processing <br>3. Output</p></div><div class="infos"><h2>Characteristics Of Computers</h2><p>1. Speed <br>2. Accuracy <br>3. Reliability <br>4. Storage</p></div><div class="infos"><h2>1. Speed</h2><p>A computer speed is very fast like computer add, subtract numbers just blink of eyes computer runs multiple programs at a time.</p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>2. Accuracy</h2><p>Computers are very accurate  computer works day to night without doing any mistakes.</p></div>  <div class="infos"><h2>3. Reliability</h2><p>Somtime accuracy depends on users. means user input if user input is correct then computer output is always correct.</p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>4. Storage</h2><p>Computer media store millions of characters of data in a condended mode.</p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>Computer Generation</h2><p>There are five types of computer generations. <br> <br> 1. First Generation (1951-1959)<br>2. Second Generation (1959-1965) <br> 3. Third Generation (1965-1971) <br>  4. Forth Generation (1971- Present)<br>5. Fift Generation (Future)</p></div><div class="infos"><h2>First Generation (1951-1959)</h2><p>Introduction of the UNIVAC-I. <br><br> <b>Features of first generation</b><br> <br> 1. Electronic circuitry used vacuum tube. <br> 2. Punched cards used for feeding information.<br>3. Punched cards and paper used for getting result. <br> 4. Magnetic  tapes used for external storage.  <br> 5. Oriented towards batch processing where entire machine  is dedicated to a particular job until completed. <br> 6.

All things are automated no need of humans to processing from one job to the next job. 3ed generation computers runs several task at a time. <br> <br> <b>Features of third Generation</b><br><br>1. Used micro-electronic instead of electronic circuitry that contains  many transistors. <br> 2. Monitor  and keyboard introduced for Output and Input. <br> 3. Magnetic disks used for external storage. <br> 4. 'Families' A concept of computer was introduced. <br> 5. More high-level language introduced like RPG(Report Program Generator), PASCAL. <br> <br> <b> </b>3ed Generation Computers Name</p><br><br>1. IBM systems/360 </div> <div class="infos"><h2>Forth Generation (1971-Present)</h2><p>Microprocessor introduced in 4th Generation. LSI and VLSI  developed. <br> <br> LSI means Large-cale Integration and placed several thousand transistors onto a single chip. <br><br> VLSI means Very Large-scale Integration and placed several hundred thousand transistors onto a single chip. <br> <br> <b>4th Generation Computers Name </b><br> <br> 1. IBM system/370 <br> 2. BURROUGHS B770 <br> 3. HP 3000</p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>Fift Generation (Future)</h2><p>Super computer introduced which is capable for calculate billions of calculations per second. <br> <br> Big boom of  Artificial intelligence(AI). multiple jobs handled by AI and Robots. many advanced changes expected. <br> <p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>Category of computers</h2><p>Computers can classified into two category : <br> <br> 1. Classification according to the logic used. <br> 2. Classification according to size.
  <p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>Classification According to logic used </h2><p>1. Analog Computers <br> 2. Digital Computers <br> <br><b>1. Analog Computers : </b><br>These types of computers usually used to measure graphs, voltage, pressure,  speed, temperature and other physical properties. <br> Examples of Analog Computers are  automobile speedometer,  Analog clock, voltmeter etc.<br><br> <b>2. Digital Computers : </b><br>Computers that runs on binary digits called Digital  Computers. <br> Examples of Digital  Computers are personal computers,   Desktop  computer. <br><br> <b> Digital  Computers are further  grouped into two categories.</b><br><br>   1. General Purpose Digital  Computers <br> Computers that used for general  work like data analysis, accounting, banking, browsing etc. called General Purpose Digital Computers <br> <br> 2. Special Purpose Digital Computers. <br> Computers that used for special works like scientific research, automobiles to control fuel, ignition instruments and barking system  are called Special Purpose Computers. </p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>3.

  <div class="infos"><h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU) :</h2><p>CPU is the component of a computer system with the circuitry to control the interpretation and execution of instructions. <br> <br> 

CPU work on <b>Input-Process-Output cycle.</b> <br> <br> 

In a microprocessor CPU mounted on the main circuit board called <b>motherboard.</b> <br> <br> 


A microprocessor contains the circuits and special storage location called <b>registers.</b> <br> <br> 
Registers perform the arithmetic, logic and control functions. <br> <br> 

<b>The Processing capabilities of microprocessor system depends upon : </b> <br> <br> 
1. Microprocessor Used <br> 
2. Clock Speed <br> 
3. Primary Storage Capacity <br> 
4. Instructions Set 
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>1. Microprocessor Used : </h2><p>A microprocessor chip can be of : <br> <br> 
1. 8 bit <br> 
2. 16 bit <br> 
3. 8/16 bit <br> 
4. 16/32 bit <br> 
5. 32/32 bit  <br> 
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>2. Clock - Speed : </h2><p>There are two cycles that occur during the processing of each program instruction. <br> <br> 


<b>1. Instruction Cycle <br> 
2. Execution Cycle </b> <br> <br> 
There cycles are synchronized by a specific number of electrical pulses produced by an electronic clock that build into the processor. <br> <br> 
The Speed with which an instruction is executed is also directly related to the chip's clock speed.
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>3. Primary Storage Capacity :</h2><p>The more the data and program can be kept in primary storage then processor processing time is fewer and boosts processing power.
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>4. Instruction Sets : </h2><p>Every microprocessor has the built- in ability to respond to a particular set of machine instructions.</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>Main Component of CPU</h2><p>1. Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) <br> 
2. Control Unit <br> 
3. Primary Storage Unit <br> 
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>1. Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) :</h2><p>
Actually all data processing occurs hare <br> <br> 
This is the place where mathematical and logical functions works. <br> <br> 
Every Arithmetic step requires at least two numbers and then it produces a result. <br> <br> 

<b>For Example : </b> In multiplication(x) we need two things to get the final product. <br> 1. Multiplicand <br> 2. Multiplier <br> 
when we inter those two inputs then we got the final product. 
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>2. Control Unit (CU) :</h2><p>Control Unit is a component of the CPU that directs the operation of the processor. <br> <br> 

Control unit directs the flow of data between the CPU and other devices. <br> <br> 

<b>for more info :</b><a href = "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_unit">visit</a>
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>3. Primary Storage Unit :</h2><p>Primary Storage used mainly for four things. <br> <br> 

1. Input/Output operations <br> 
2. Manipulation of text and calculation operations <br> 
3. Logic/comparison operations <br> 
4. Storage and retrieval operations</p></div>

  Topic: `<div class="infos"><h2>Computer</h2><p>The computer is an electronic machine that runs on three principles. <br><br>1. Input <br>2. Processing <br>3. Output</p></div><div class="infos"><h2>Characteristics Of Computers</h2><p>1. Speed <br>2. Accuracy <br>3. Reliability <br>4. Storage</p></div><div class="infos"><h2>1. Speed</h2><p>A computer speed is very fast like computer add, subtract numbers just blink of eyes computer runs multiple programs at a time.</p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>2. Accuracy</h2><p>Computers are very accurate  computer works day to night without doing any mistakes.</p></div>  <div class="infos"><h2>3. Reliability</h2><p>Somtime accuracy depends on users. means user input if user input is correct then computer output is always correct.</p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>4. Storage</h2><p>Computer media store millions of characters of data in a condended mode.</p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>Computer Generation</h2><p>There are five types of computer generations. <br> <br> 1. First Generation (1951-1959)<br>2. Second Generation (1959-1965) <br> 3. Third Generation (1965-1971) <br>  4. Forth Generation (1971- Present)<br>5. Fift Generation (Future)</p></div><div class="infos"><h2>First Generation (1951-1959)</h2><p>Introduction of the UNIVAC-I. <br><br> <b>Features of first generation</b><br> <br> 1. Electronic circuitry used vacuum tube. <br> 2. Punched cards used for feeding information.<br>3. Punched cards and paper used for getting result. <br> 4. Magnetic  tapes used for external storage.  <br> 5. Oriented towards batch processing where entire machine  is dedicated to a particular job until completed. <br> 6. Human operations had to set switches. <br> 7. Development of machine language and assembly language. <br> <br> <b>First  Generation Computers Name</b><br> <br> 1. UNIVAC-I <br> 2. IBM 650 <br> 3. BURROUGHS 220 <br> </p></div> <div class="infos"><h2>Second Generation (1959-1965)</h2><p>Transistors introduced in 2ed Generation. That's why 2ed Generation computers was very  fast, reliable  as compare to 1st Generation. <br> <br> <b>Features  of Second Generation</b><br> <br> 1. Electronic circuitry characterized by the use of Transistors.  <br> 2. For output  used Punched card and paper <br> 3. For external storage used magnetic tape. <br> 4. Multiple  users were capable of using the machine concurrently. <br> 5. Now human operations handled by punched card. <br><br>In 2ed Generation introduce high-level language like FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC , PL/1 <br><br> <b>2ed Generation Computers Name</b><br> <br>1. IBM 1400 Series and 7000 Series <br> 2. Control Data 3600 <br> 3. General Electric 635 <br>4. Honeywell 200</p></div> `

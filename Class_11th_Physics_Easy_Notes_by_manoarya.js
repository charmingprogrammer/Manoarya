  <h2>Know About Science</h2>
  <p>Science is a careful and defth observation of natural phenomenon. <br><br> Word science come from Latin verb 'Scientica'. <br> Scientica meaning id 'To know'. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="infos">
  <h2>Scientific methods</h2>
  <p>Method or rules of scientific research is called scientific method. <br><br> <b>Some scientific method are following. </b><br><br>1. Systematic observations <br>2. Controlled experiments. <br> 3. Qualitative and quantitative reasoning <br>4. Mathematics modeling <br>5. Predictions <br>6. Verificationof theory <br><br> To apply one science theory or formula. First check that this theory of formula is complete all the steps of scientific method and also philosophical debate by many scientists and philosophers. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="infos">
  <h2>Natural Science</h2>
  <p>What we study in physics chemistry and biology all the stuff known as natural science. <br><br> <b>Physics :</b> Physics  is the study of nature and its law. <br><br> Word physics comes from Greek Word which meaning is natural. <br> <br><b>Two principles of physics.</b><br> <br>1. Unification <br>2. Reduction</p>
  </div>
  <div class="infos">
  <h2>Unification</h2>
  <p>Try to explain and understand natural phenomena in same theory or formula. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="infos">
  <h2>Reduction</h2>
  <p>Try to explain complex natural phenomena to  simpler way known as reduction.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="infos">
  <h2>Scope and craze of physics</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="infos"><h2>Two domains we have to get some idea of the scope of physics.</h2><p>
1. Macroscopic <br> 
2. Microscopic <br> <br> 

<b>1. Macroscopic : </b>The macroscopic domain includes phenomena at laboratory and astronomical scales. <br> <br> 

<b>2. Microscopic :</b>The microscopic domain includes atomic, molicular and nuclear phenomena.
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>Classical Physics :</h2><p>Classical physics deals with macroscopic phenomena and include subject like mechinics, electrodynamic, optics and thermodynamic.</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>Fundamental forces in nature.</h2><p>
1. Gravitational Forces <br> 
2. Electromagnetic Forces <br> 
3. Strong Nuckear Forces <br> 
4. Weak Nuclear Forces <br>
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>1. Gravitational Forces :</h2><p>The gravitational force is the force of mutual attraction between two objects by property of their masses. <br> <br> 


Gravitational Force is the universal force. <br> 
Means, every object on the universe experience gravitational force.
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>2. Electromagnetic Force :</h2><p>The Electromagnetic Forces is the force between charged particles. <br><br>

Electromagnetic forces are more powerful as compair to gravitational force. <br> <br> 

Gravity is always attract, but Elcotomegnatic force can be attract or repulse.
</p></div> 
 
<div class="infos"><h2>3. Strong Nuclear Force :</h2><p>The strong nuclear force binds protons and neutrons in a nucleus. <br> <br> 
Strong Nuclear Force is the strongest force as compair to all fundamental forces.
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>4. Weak Nuclear Force :</h2><p>The weak nuclear force appears only in certain nuclear process such as the B-dacay of a nucleus. <br> <br> 


The Weak Nuclear Force is the weak nuclear force but not weak from gravitational force.</p></div>

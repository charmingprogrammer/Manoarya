  Topic: `<div class="infos"><h2>What is Chemistry ?</h2><p>Chemistry is the study of the materials that make up the universe and the changes which these materials make. <br> <br> 
Chemistry is called the science of atom and molecules. 
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>Importance of chemistry</h2><p>Chemistry is very important in our life because we live our daily life with chemistry.
<br> <br> 
<b>Let's see how ?</b>
In Computer world : Silicon chip <br> 
In Agriculture : Fertilizers and insecticides <br> 

In food : preservatives <br> 
In health : drugs <br> 
In shelter : cement, bricks and plastics. <br> 

In transport : fuel, petroleum. <br> 
In warfare : destructive gases and bombs <br> <br> 

Every aspect of life we see chemistry so it is very important to know about chemistry and explore chemistry.

<div class="infos"><h2>Matter :</h2><p>Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space is called matter. <br> <br> 

Matter can be classified into <b>two</b> ways : <br> <br> 
1. Physical classification of matter <br> 
2. Chemical classification of matter
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>Physical classification of matter</h2><p>Three Types of matter we have according to physical classification. <br> <br> 

1. Solid <br> 
2. Liquids <br> 
3. Gasses <br> 
</p></div> 
<div class="infos"><h2>1. Soid</h2><p>Objects that have a fixed volume and shape are called solid. <br> <br> 

<b>Example :</b> Chair, pain, book...etc. <br> <br> 

Solid particles are tightly packed. That's why solid volume and shape are fixed.
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>2. Liquid : </h2><p>Objects that have a fixed volume but not fixed shape are called liquid. <br> <br> 

<b>Example : </b>water, oil, milk...etc. <br> <br> 

Liquids take container's shape. <br><br> 
Liquids particles are close to each other but not tightly packed. That's why liquids take the container's shape.
</p></div> 

<div class="infos"><h2>3. Gasses : </h2><p>Objects that have not fixed volume and shape are called gasses.
<br> <br> 

<b>Example : </b>Air, oxygen, co2â€¦.etc. <br> <br> 

Gasses flow easily and spread in the environment very fast.
<br><br> 
Gasses particles are very far from each other, that's why gasses are spared so fast.
<br> <br> 
Gas also takes the container's shape.
</p></div>

<div class="infos"><h2>Matter state change : </h2><p>We can change the state of matters, meaning we can change solid to liquid and liquid to solid. <br> <br>

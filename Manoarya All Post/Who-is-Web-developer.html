				<p>
					<b>Category : </b> <span id="category">Explanation</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hey, we're here to tell you about web development. This post covered all the necessary information
					to become a web developer with an awesome explanation. <br><br>

					This post provides sources where you can learn and practice. <br>

					Also you get lots of project ideas to practice all the stack. <br><br>
					You can now proceed with whatever you want from this list.

				<h2>What is Web development?</h2>

				<p>
					We see lots of websites every day. Do you know how to make this website? <br> <br>

					Creating the web pages known as web development. And who creates these pages is known as a web
					developer. <br> <br>

					So in this article we learn about how the web pages are built and how to deploy that on the
					internet. So I hope you are excited to learn. <br> <br>
					Let's go. <br> <br>Web development is done by two types of developers or a single developer.
				</p>

				<h2>Front End Developer</h2>
				<p>
					Development of the website that you can see on the internet Cleary is known as a front end
					development.
					<br> <br> A person who creates these types of websites is known as a front end developer.
					<br> <br> Front End Developer have following skills : <br> <br> HTMl, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap,
					React Jsâ€¦.etc
					<br> <br>Hare is the brief intro to build your career as a front end developer.
					<br> <br> So, we see the web pages on the internet is build by mostly using following tech

					<br> <br>
					<b>1. HTML(Hypertext markup Language)
					</b> <br> <br>
					Html is the structure of any web page. Just like your bones is the structure of your body.
					<br> <br>

					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">Start learning HTML Now </a> <br> <br>

					It is a very important and essential skill for web development.
					<br> <br>

					<b>2. CSS (Cascading style sheet)</b><br><br>You see different websites with different color looks
					and styles. The style of the pages is done by CSS.
					<br> <br>Your bones are covered with skin. Just like that CSS is the cover of the HTML to give it a
					beautiful style.
					<br> <br>


					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">Start Learning CSS Now</a><br> <br> <b>3.
						JS(Java-Script) : </b> <br> <br> In a website we see buttons and a sidebar and lot's more
					things. <br><br>Consider when you click on any button and it works and when you click on the
					navigation bar and open the sidebar and when you click on the corress button then the sidebar is
					closed.
					<br> <br> All the activities and actions performed on the web page are scripted in Javascript. <br>
					<br> It is just like your fingers and hand works on your body. <br> <br>

					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Start Learning Js Now</a> <br> <br>
					If you learn these things now you are ready to build beautiful pages that you see on the web.<br>
					<br> I suggest you build these following projects for better understanding. <br> <br>

					<br>


					Now you can explore some JS libraries and frameworks to build faster.
					<br> <br>
					I suggest you learn React Js for creating high-quality user interface(UI). And bootstrap which is a
					css framework to create beautiful styles.
					<br> <br>
					Now you can learn about github and gits.

					<br> <br>
					Github is an awesome platform to share your projects all over the world.
				</p>
		
				<h2>Backend End Developer</h2>
				<p>
					Development of the website that you can't see on the internet Cleary is known as a back end
					development. <br> <br>A person who codes these types of algorithms is known as a back end developer.
					<br> <br> I hope you see and know that contact forms exist on most web pages which are built by
					front end developers. <br> <br> Do you know when you fill all the inputs on the form and click on
					the submit button. <br> <br> Then where your data goes and who handles these types of things. <br>
					<br> Yes, exactly that's types of developers known as a backend developer.
					<br><br><b>Backend developers have the following skills.</b><br><br>
					Python <br>
					PHP <br>
					SQL Database â€¦etc <br>
					<b>Python : </b>
					Python is the highest-level , general purpose programming language used by millions of programmers
					to create server side web programming. <br><br>

					Python is most popular programming Language according to PYPLE Index.
					You can do multiple jobs if you learn python. <br><br>

					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">Learn Python</a> <br> <br>

					<b>PHP : </b>
					PHP is a server-side programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. <br><br>
					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp">Learn PHP</a> <br><br>
					<b>SQL</b>
					A SQL database is used to store data for retrieval and manipulation. <br><br>
					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp">Learn SQL</a> <br><br>


					There are now more skills you need to learn, but the essentials are already done. <br> <br>

				<h2>Project Idea for backend developer</h2>
				<p>Make a movie app which supports API(Application Programming Interface),Database,CURD(Create Update
					Read Delete). <br><br>

					MemeMaker/InspireMe - Stand-alone service for putting text over images like those inspirational
					posters with quotes.
					A second idea is to use blank meme images and let them add their own text to them (numerous sites
					exist for this). <br><br>

					ScheduleMaker - This one's harder. Can develop the database schema or an application. Let one user
					define the schedule for others. Or let users select their own schedule. <br><br>

					RSS Picker - Use an RSS library like SimplePie and provide the ability to add multiple RSS feeds and
					let the user pick specific news items from the aggregated list. <br><br>

					Github Clone - Requires user system(single would work). Create a system like github's Gist which
					allows a user to create a page from markdown syntax. <br><br>

					College Scoreboard - data.gov provides a 'college scoreboard' API. Use this API to build a site
					where users can select various schools in their area. <br><br>


					oAuth Login - Recommend this one because it can replace a user system in some of these examples.
					Numerous libraries exist for setting this up. <br><br>

					Simple CRUD sites - Create, Read,Update,Delete (read includes list). Possible 'objects' could be Dog
					Breeds, any type of pet, plants, flowers etc. Level of detail is up to you. Locations like Museums,
					National Parks. <br><br>

					RESTful API - use the same list from the CRUD sites but make it available as an API. <br><br>


					Localhost Image Upload - Make a file upload script for use with wifi only devices (cell phones w/o
					service). Image upload and browsing of photos.
				</p>

				<h2>Full Stack web Developer</h2>
				<p>
					A single person who builds a whole website alone is known as a full stack web developer.<br>
					<br>Full stack web developers have both frontend and backend web developer skills. <br> <br>
					Full stack web developer is one man army for the whole website. <br> <br>Fastest way to become a
					full stack web developer.
					<br> <br>I suggest you learn Javascript deeply. Because this is a very important skill that boosts
					your coding journey to the next level.<br> <br>
				</p>

				<h2>Introducing MERN Stack</h2>
				<p>
					Learn MERN stack if you want to become a full stack web developer fast. The best parts of the MERN
					stack only use a single programming language called Javascript. <br> <br>
					MERN stands for MongoDB(Database),Express js, React js, Node js. <br> <br>

					<b>Brief explanation of Mern tech</b> <br><br>
					<b>MongoDB :</b> MongoDB is a widely used database that supports the JSON document database module.
					<br>
					MongoDB used to store and retrieve data from this database. Used for creating high quality MERN
					stack web apps. <br><br>
					<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">Learn More</a> <br><br>


					<b>Express Js :</b> Express js is the web framework for Node js to creating the fastest and
					minimalist web
					applications. <br><br>
					<a href="https://expressjs.com/">Learn More</a> <br><br>

					<b>React Js :</b> React js is the javascript library to create modern and interactive user
					interfaces.
					React is built by Facebook and it is the most loved javascript library. <br>
					One of the best things about React js is that you only have to learn it once and you can use it
					everywhere. <br><br>
					<b>You can build Mobile Application using React Native.</b>

				<h2>Project for MERN Stack Developer</h2>
				<p>Create a facebook clone, youtube clone, tinder clone, tic toc clone, to do list maker.
					I suggest you watch this video for better knowledge of the MERN stack.
				</p>
		
				<h2>Frequently Asked Question</h2>

				<p>
					<b>Web Developer vs Web Designer</b> <br> <br> Web developer work is to build and maintain the
					websites and they have better knowledge about these languages HTML, CSS, Javascript. <br> <br> And
					also they know about React js, Angular js, JQuery, sass, Bootstrap, gits and github. <br> <br> Web
					developers used visual studio code, sublime Text editor..etc.
					<br><br> And on the other hand web designers have worked to design and create relational databases
					and create the web's layout for web developers.
					<br> <br> Web Designers have these skills in graphic, design, color patterns, layout and logo
					design...etc. <br> <br> They used these technologies for creating stunning designs like Adobe
					Photoshop, Illustration. <br> <br> I hope you like the FAQ section. Please suggest your thoughts to
					implement more FAQs. Thanks in Advance.

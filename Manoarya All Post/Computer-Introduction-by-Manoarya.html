	<h2>Computer</h2>
<p>
	The computer is an electronic machine that runs on three principles. <br><br>1. Input <br>2. Processing <br>3. Output
</p>
<h2>Characteristics Of Computers</h2>
<p>
	1. Speed <br>2. Accuracy <br>3. Reliability <br>4. Storage
</p>
<h2>1. Speed</h2>
<p>
	A computer speed is very fast like computer add, subtract numbers just blink of eyes computer runs multiple programs at a time.
</p>
<h2>2. Accuracy</h2>
<p>
	Computers are very accurate  computer works day to night without doing any mistakes.
</p>
<h2>3. Reliability</h2>
<p>
	Somtime accuracy depends on users. means user input if user input is correct then computer output is always correct.
</p>
<h2>4. Storage</h2>
<p>
	Computer media store millions of characters of data in a condended mode.
</p>
<h2>Computer Generation</h2>
<p>
	There are five types of computer generations. <br> <br> 1. First Generation (1951-1959)<br>2. Second Generation (1959-1965) <br> 3. Third Generation (1965-1971) <br>  4. Forth Generation (1971- Present)<br>5. Fift Generation (Future)
</p>
<h2>First Generation (1951-1959)</h2>
<p>
	Introduction of the UNIVAC-I. <br><br> <b>Features of first generation</b><br> <br> 1. Electronic circuitry used vacuum tube. <br> 2. Punched cards used for feeding information.<br>3. Punched cards and paper used for getting result. <br> 4. Magnetic  tapes used for external storage.  <br> 5. Oriented towards batch processing where entire machine  is dedicated to a particular job until completed. <br> 6. Human operations had to set switches. <br> 7. Development of machine language and assembly language. <br> <br> <b>First  Generation Computers Name</b><br> <br> 1. UNIVAC-I <br> 2. IBM 650 <br> 3. BURROUGHS 220 <br>
</p>
<h2>Second Generation (1959-1965)</h2>
<p>
	Transistors introduced in 2ed Generation. That's why 2ed Generation computers was very  fast, reliable  as compare to 1st Generation. <br> <br> <b>Features  of Second Generation</b><br> <br> 1. Electronic circuitry characterized by the use of Transistors.  <br> 2. For output  used Punched card and paper <br> 3. For external storage used magnetic tape. <br> 4. Multiple  users were capable of using the machine concurrently. <br> 5. Now human operations handled by punched card. <br><br>In 2ed Generation introduce high-level language like FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC , PL/1 <br><br> <b>2ed Generation Computers Name</b><br> <br>1. IBM 1400 Series and 7000 Series <br> 2. Control Data 3600 <br> 3. General Electric 635 <br>4. Honeywell 200
</p>
<h2>Third Generation (1965-1971)</h2>
<p>
	Introduce  advance machine hardware with advance software. All things are automated no need of humans to processing from one job to the next job. 3ed generation computers runs several task at a time. <br> <br> <b>Features of third Generation</b><br><br>1. Used micro-electronic instead of electronic circuitry that contains  many transistors. <br> 2. Monitor  and keyboard introduced for Output and Input. <br> 3. Magnetic disks used for external storage. <br> 4. 'Families' A concept of computer was introduced. <br> 5. More high-level language introduced like RPG(Report Program Generator), PASCAL. <br> <br> <b> </b>3ed Generation Computers Name
</p>
<br><br>1. IBM systems/360  <h2>Forth Generation (1971-Present)</h2>
<p>
	Microprocessor introduced in 4th Generation. LSI and VLSI  developed. <br> <br> LSI means Large-cale Integration and placed several thousand transistors onto a single chip. <br><br> VLSI means Very Large-scale Integration and placed several hundred thousand transistors onto a single chip. <br> <br> <b>4th Generation Computers Name </b><br> <br> 1. IBM system/370 <br> 2. BURROUGHS B770 <br> 3. HP 3000
</p>
<h2>Fift Generation (Future)</h2>
<p>
	Super computer introduced which is capable for calculate billions of calculations per second. <br> <br> Big boom of  Artificial intelligence(AI). multiple jobs handled by AI and Robots. many advanced changes expected. <br> 
	</p>
		<h2>Category of computers</h2>
		<p>
			Computers can classified into two category : <br> <br> 1. Classification according to the logic used. <br> 2. Classification according to size.
			</p>
<h2>classified based on logic used</h2>
<p>
					1. Analog Computers <br> 2. Digital Computers <br> <br><b>1. Analog Computers : </b><br>These types of computers usually used to measure graphs, voltage, pressure,  speed, temperature and other physical properties. <br> Examples of Analog Computers are  automobile speedometer,  Analog clock, voltmeter etc.<br><br> <b>2. Digital Computers : </b><br>Computers that runs on binary digits called Digital  Computers. <br> Examples of Digital  Computers are personal computers,   Desktop  computer. <br><br> <b> Digital  Computers are further  grouped into two categories.</b><br><br>   1. General Purpose Digital  Computers <br> Computers that used for general  work like data analysis, accounting, banking, browsing etc. called General Purpose Digital Computers <br> <br> 2. Special Purpose Digital Computers. <br> Computers that used for special works like scientific research, automobiles to control fuel, ignition instruments and barking system  are called Special Purpose Computers.
				</p>
<h2>3. Hybrid computers  : </h2>
<p>
					Hybrid computers are the combinations of analog and digital computers . <br> <br>
					Hybrid computers speed like a analog computers and accuracy like a digital computers. <br> <br>
